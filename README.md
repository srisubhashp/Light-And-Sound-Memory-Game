## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

 During the process, I bi-mistakely missed a step and went ahead, later I realized the output wasn't similar to the GIF displayed in the tutorial. It was a good experience, trying to find the which statement I missed. 
 First, I made a list of important stages through out the project, then slowly reverted back and found out the correct reason to the problem.
 I learned the importance of debugging through this assignment, and the strategies (eg: effective commenting) to use to make sure we always stay on track, while coding.    

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  While completing this assignment, i was researching about the various languages used in web-development, and came across many web stacks such as MEAN, MERN, etc. used by developers. 
  I am interested to know which stack would be used in which all scenarios.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 
 If I had more time, I would implement color changing patterns to make the game more exciting. And add more alerts to the game to make it more user-friends. Add account registration functionality, and recognize the players with the highest scores.
